                    <h2>Foundational Structures for Effective Business Management</h2>
                    <p>
                        This course will help entrepreneurs understand how to create a 
                        functional structure for their business. It will analyze the 
                        various structures that exist with business stakeholders and the 
                        various relationships that guarantee success in the long run. 
                        To manage a small business, entrepreneurs have to understand the 
                        various components on which success will depend on, the availability 
                        of leverage, the support of business mentors and the collaboration 
                        between the core team to achieve the corporate vision. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many small businesses bleed substantial resources profusely because 
                        they have failed to put in place a effective structure that can support 
                        their growth. This is partly the reason many small businesses never 
                        take off – because business owners are more fixated about ownership 
                        than they are about building structures that guarantee business success. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The right business structure will help entrepreneurs build for the long 
                        term, enabling them to withstand the unforeseen challenges of a murky 
                        business climate.

                    <p>
                        This course will arm participants with the knowledge to build businesses 
                        that stand the test of time as they learn how to build a solid foundation.

                    <p>
                        Many entrepreneurs have a difficulty differentiating sales 
                        from marketing. Fundamentally, sales refers to all activities 
                        that lead to the selling of goods and services while marketing 
                        refer to all activities that get people interested in the goods 
                        and services offered by any company. Many companies with great
